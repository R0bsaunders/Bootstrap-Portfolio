# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio, but this time built using Custom styled Bootstrap. It isn't exactly the same because although I started to style it to be an exact replica, I realised that this defeats the object and made it take longer. The process was sped up after this realisation. Using bootstrap, the website contains the following items:

* A navigation menu at the top with relevant working links
* A hero section using a jumbotron
* A work section using Bootstrap cards displaying my work in a grid with a breif description
* A skills section showing my development skills
* An about section with contact details
* A footer with hyperlinks. All hyperlinks must have a hover-effect and display a box-shadow on hover

There should be minimal use of media queries and the website must be deployed to GitHub pages with a regualar commit history
